Q>	I defined a new banner from the admin area but it's not showing up - why?
A>	The theme you're using needs to know to display a banner. Open the theme.php of the theme and make sure you have {BANNER} or {BANNER=yourcampaignname} in the $HEADER section.

Q>	I want to one set of banners in one area and a different set in another area - how?
A>	You can group your banners under 'campaigns', and then set up your theme to show banners from certain campaigns. For example, if you had two campaigns, called cam_1 and cam_2, putting {BANNER=cam1} in one area of your $HEADER section in the theme.php will show only cam_1 banners, and putting {BANNER=cam_2} in another area will only show cam_2 banners. Putting {BANNER} (no campaign name) in your theme.php will show random banners from all campaigns.

Q>	What's the client login and client password for?
A>	You can define a login and password for your banner clients, they can then use these to access information about how their banners are performing by going to http://yoursite.com/banner.php and entering the name and pass.

Q>	How can I have a 'tower' type banner in a menu item?
A>	First you need to define the campaign for the tower type banners (this will keep them separate from bar type banners) ...
	1. Go to your admin area and click on banners.
	2. Enter your tower-type banner(s), make sure you use a new campaign name, for example 'towers'.
	3. Now go to your Menus area, and activate the Banner_menu into one of your menu areas.
	4. Click on the 'Configure' link in the menu item.
	5. Enter the caption title (by default it's 'Advertisement'), and enter the campaign name you defined before.
	6. Leave your admin area and you'll see your tower-type banner(s) in the area you assigned them to.
